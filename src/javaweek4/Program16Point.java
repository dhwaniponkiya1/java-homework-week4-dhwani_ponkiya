/**
 * You have to represent a point in 2D space. Write a class with the name Point. The class needs two
 * fields (instance variables) with name x and y of type int.
 * The class needs to have two constructors. The first constructor does not have any parameters (no-arg
 * constructor). The second constructor has parameters x and y of type int and it needs to initialize the
 * fields.
 * Write the following methods (instance methods):
 * * Method named getX without any parameters, it needs to return the value of x field.
 * * Method named getY without any parameters, it needs to return the value of y field.
 * * Method named setX with one parameter of type int, it needs to set the value of the x field.
 * * Method named setY with one parameter of type int, it needs to set the value of the y field.
 * * Method named distance without any parameters, it needs to return the distance between this
 * Point and Point 0,0 as double.
 * * Method named distance with two parameters x, y both of type int, it needs to return the distance
 * between this Point and Point x,y as double.
 * * Method named distance with parameter another of type Point, it needs to return the distance
 * between this Point and another Point as double.
 * How to find the distance between two points?
 * To find a distance between points A(xA,yA) and B(xB,yB), we use the formula:
 * d(A,B)=√ (xB − xA) * (xB - xA) + (yB − yA) * (yB - yA)
 * Where √ represents square root.
