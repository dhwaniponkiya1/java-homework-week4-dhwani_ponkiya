 * 1. Write a class with the name Circle. The class needs one field (instance variable) with name radius
 * of type double.
 * The class needs to have one constructor with parameter radius of type double and it needs to initialize
 * the fields.
 * In case the radius parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the radius field value to 0.
 * Write the following methods (instance methods):
 * ● Method named getRadius without any parameters, it needs to return the value of the radius
 * field.
 * ● Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated area
 * (radius * radius * PI). For PI use Math.PI constant.
